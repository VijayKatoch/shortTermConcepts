Brushed DC Motor Driving

X-NUCLEO-IHM04A1

For our board, Low Voltage board ( 1.8 to 10V ) is enough

	X-NUCLEO-IHM12A1 ( This has only 1.3 A rms )

Another low voltage but high current  (2.6 A rms) and cheaper Problem: Only for one DC motor

	X-NUCLEO-IHM13A1

Selected : X-NUCLEO-IHM12A1
 Taking Risk as max current per motor is 1.3 A rms, and MG 996 on its website says 1400 mA Stall and in datasheet at 2.5A max
 But I don't think it will be that high
