Tower Pro Inside

1. After cutting open dc motor

It has 3 pole Brushed motor inside, it is also proven with this link below:

2. 	On PCB it has three 8 pins, PF6CB FDS 9926A chips, which seems to be Dual-N channel 2.5V MOSFET

	It is used to drive (switch)motor current from supply Vs. In full bridge rectifier setup you need two
	of these, for 3 pole three to create H Bridge, so that motor can be turned both side
	
3.	Two numbers of J3Y transistors in SOT-23 package

4. One unknown 3pin, HT33
