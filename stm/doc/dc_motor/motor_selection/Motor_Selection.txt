	DC 6V, 30 RPM

	As shown in table, it provides
	2.7 Kg/cm Load torque and 4.6 Kg/cm Stall Torque at 0.6A and 1.8 A current.
	Currents can be handled by our selected motor driver board x-nucleo-ihm12a1

	4.6 Kg/m stall torque, can thus hold approx. 460 gm load at 20 cm long distance
	(assume equally distributed at 10 cm length)
