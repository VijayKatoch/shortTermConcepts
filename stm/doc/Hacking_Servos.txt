	more juise => P gain , D = Disaster but The D you definitely don't need here, that's for systems that are slow to react to a change of input. Your motor reacts instantly on a change of power supplied.
	The I you may or may not need, depending on your overall system.
	
	A PID algorithm as noted bove has virtually no relevance to an integrated proportional RC servo.
